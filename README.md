# Func_LED (working progress)
[https://tinkersprojects.com/](https://tinkersprojects.com/)

This library is similar to the RGB_LED Library but is made for only one LED instead of 3 to make colours. This Arduino library is to the control a LED's fading and can be synced with other LED to make any colour and fade between them. Almost every setting can be controlled through this library for a LED. The library contains preset functions to make it easier to construct your LED project.
